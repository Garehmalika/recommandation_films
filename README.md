# Film Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering

## Project Description
This project focuses on building a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. The primary goal is to predict the preferences of users based on their past behaviors and interactions with content, providing personalized movie recommendations.

### Objective
The main objective of this project is to explore two widely-used techniques for collaborative filtering: 
1. **Matrix Factorization**: Decomposing a large user-item matrix into two smaller matrices representing latent factors of users and items.
2. **Matrix Completion using Convex Optimization**: Filling missing values in the matrix to predict ratings for unseen movies using convex optimization methods.

By applying these methods, we aim to enhance the quality of recommendations, even with incomplete data, and provide a system that predicts the probability of a user enjoying a particular movie.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project consists of user interactions with movies, including:
- **User Ratings**: Ratings given by users for movies (e.g., on a scale of 1-5).
- **Movie Information**: Includes movie titles, genres, and other related metadata.
- **User Information**: Basic details about users, which might include demographic information, though the focus here is on the interaction data.

The dataset used for this project can be found [here](URL to dataset) (for example, from sources like MovieLens).

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis, modeling, and building the recommendation system.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and matrix operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: For advanced optimization techniques (optional).
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization and model evaluation.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For exploratory data analysis and model development.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- **Data Extraction**: Gather user ratings, movie metadata, and user information.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, normalize ratings, and ensure data consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualize user ratings, movie popularity, and rating distributions to understand data patterns.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- **Matrix Factorization**: Implement matrix factorization techniques (such as Singular Value Decomposition, SVD) to decompose the user-item matrix into latent factor matrices.
- **Matrix Completion using Convex Optimization**: Use optimization techniques to fill missing values in the user-item interaction matrix.

### 3. Model Building
- **Collaborative Filtering Model**: Build and train the collaborative filtering model using both matrix factorization and matrix completion techniques.
- **Model Optimization**: Tune hyperparameters and improve model performance using techniques like cross-validation.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate model accuracy using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Precision-Recall.
- **Comparison of Methods**: Compare the performance of matrix factorization and matrix completion in terms of prediction accuracy and recommendation quality.

## Results
- **Matrix Factorization Model**: Predicts user preferences and ranks movies based on their latent factors, achieving an accuracy of [insert accuracy metric here].
- **Matrix Completion Model**: Fills missing values in the user-item matrix, improving recommendation quality for users with incomplete data.
- **Insights**: Identifying the best-performing technique for predicting user ratings and recommending movies.

## Future Work
- **Deep Learning**: Implement neural collaborative filtering methods or hybrid models combining content-based and collaborative filtering.
- **Real-Time Recommendations**: Integrate the model into a real-time recommendation system for platforms like Netflix or Hulu.
- **Context-Aware Recommendations**: Incorporate contextual information such as time of day, user mood, or device type into the recommendation process.
